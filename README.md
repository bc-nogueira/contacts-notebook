# README

I made this project to study Rails a little more.

I used Ruby I18n to make the application work in Brazilian Portuguese and in English.

I also used Complex Forms that allow to create rich forms called "nested attributes". It allows you to combine more than one model in your forms while keeping the same basic code pattern that you use with simple single model form.

To use this application simply download or clone this repository and run the rails application.

* Ruby version: 2.3.1

* Rails version: 5.0.6

* Most important gems used:

    * bootstrap 4 beta
    * font-awesome
